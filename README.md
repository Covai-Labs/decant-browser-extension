## Why Decant?

Most clippers either send your browsed content to a third-party server for "AI extraction", or wrap your page in heavy single-file dumps you can't actually reuse.

Decant goes the other way: it turns any page into **clean, structured Markdown you own** — fast, locally, and with a single click of the icon or a shortcut.

Key differentiators:

- **Multi-Tab Batch Clipper (`Alt+Shift+A`)** — ingest every open research tab into a single clean ZIP of structured Markdown files.
- **1-Click PKM hand-off** — direct URL-scheme triggers for Obsidian, Logseq, Bear, NotePlan, and Drafts with customizable YAML frontmatter.
- **Strictly local extraction** — Mozilla Readability runs on-device; nothing your browser reads ever leaves your machine.

---

## Key Features

- 🗂️ **Multi-Tab Batch Clipper (`Alt+Shift+A`):** Clip all open tabs in the current window into one organized ZIP archive — individual Markdown files per tab. Ideal for research sessions, literature round-ups, and "save the whole reading list" moments.
- 📝 **Clean Markdown:** Extract articles and main content into clean, structured Markdown with proper headings, tables, code fences, and preserved links.
- 🔄 **1-Click PKM Note-taking Hand-off:** Send clipped content straight into **Obsidian** (`obsidian://new`), **Logseq**, **Bear**, **NotePlan**, or **Drafts** with customizable frontmatter (`title`, `date`, `url`, custom tags).
- 👁️ **Live Preview Studio & Reader View:** Preview the decanted result in a clean reading view with **KaTeX** math rendering and **Prism** syntax highlighting across Dark, Light, and Solarized themes — before you save.
- 📊 **Export Format Matrix:** Download as **Markdown (`.md`)**, **HTML (`.html`)**, **Word (`.doc`)**, or **JSON (`.json`)**, or copy to clipboard.
- ⚡ **Side Panel & Shortcuts:** Clip, copy, and preview from the native Chromium side panel, plus keyboard shortcuts — `Alt+Shift+C` copy, `Alt+Shift+D` download, `Alt+Shift+A` batch clip.
- 🖱️ **Right-click menus:** Decant the page or a text selection from the context menu.
- 🎨 **Custom Frontmatter & Formatting:** Configurable templates for metadata tags, page URLs, titles, and dates.
- 🔒 **100% Private & Local:** All parsing happens on-device in your browser. Zero tracking or telemetry. See [Privacy](#privacy).

## Privacy

Decant is **strictly local by design** — the same philosophy as the on-device extraction it uses.

| Permission                | Why it's needed                                                            |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `activeTab` / `scripting` | Inject the content script to extract the page only when you trigger a clip |
| `storage`                 | Save your local preferences (frontmatter template, format, app target)     |
| `downloads`               | Save `.md` files directly to your device                                   |
| `clipboardWrite`          | Copy Markdown to your clipboard                                            |
| `contextMenus`            | Add right-click "Decant to Markdown" menu items                            |

No third-party APIs. No analytics. No telemetry endpoints. No server round-trips — content only touches memory, the clipboard, your downloads folder, or your PKM app. Audit it yourself: [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) and the full [source](https://github.com/Covai-Labs/decant).
